#+TITLE: Agenda in Org
#+DESCRIPTION: This is my agenda file for Org-mode. Apparently, =org= can do anything. Therefore, why not trying the agenda?
#+STARTUP: overview

This is my agenda file. It will be divided into sections, for every component of my tasks.

* Side projects: tools [0/3]
** TODO Look in to =org-super-agenda= [0/2]
- [ ] Look at the website
- [ ] Small working example
** TODO Implement email in Emacs
** TODO Create my own email and website [0/2]
- [ ] Look at Luke Smith's video on how to set up a server and get a domain name. Do that
- [ ] To actually write some content, look for [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] to create static websites. Play with that
* My research [5/7]
** DONE Do some plots [3/3]
CLOSED: [2021-01-19 Tue 02:41]
- [X] Test how my global settings worked for matplotlib
- [X] Switch the /axis/ of $\ell$ and $a$ in the plots of $f$
- [X] Produce every possible plot, switching the axis, but also playing with $\Delta$ for $a$ and $\ell$
** DONE Use =mathematica= to make 3D plots
CLOSED: [2021-01-19 Tue 21:50]
** DONE Possible conference: Network science society  [1/1]
CLOSED: [2021-01-25 Mon 00:34]
All information is in my email. In the meantime, the first step is to write a draft for the abstract
- [X] Write the abstract for the possible presentation
** READ Look for the basic papers needed to write the empirical results [0/2]
- [ ] Papers about phone calls in general
- [ ] Papers about communication in general
** DONE Create a separate phone call dataframe from MIT
CLOSED: [2021-01-29 Fri 02:26]
The idea in this dataframe is that looking at the /first appeareance of egos/ plot, I can /guesstimate/ $d$ days to make an adjustment to the data. The maximum lifetime of any alter that appear on day $d$ will be $T - d$. Therefore, the maximum value I will consider for the new dataset will be exctly that, $T - d$.
** DONE A new measurement
CLOSED: [2021-02-05 Fri 02:41]
It involves taking the sum of $f$ over all egos, then divide that number by $H(\lambda)$ and then divide by the number of egos to obtain $\langle b \rangle$ and possibly $\langle g \rangle$ (if I have enough time).
** TODO Test for Dunbar's results [3/3]
The idea is that people tend to have a /layer 0/ of contacts with whom they communicate very frequently. Then comes layer 1 with about 4 or 5 people with a still high frequency of communication. In order to identify these two layers.
- [X] Produce $H(\lambda, \Delta\ell = 30)$ and get the number of alters in the higher values of $\lambda$
- [X] Take the average of the number in the previous point for all egos
- [X] Plot the results
* Networks and Society [2/6]
** DONE Do the reading list [2/3]
CLOSED: [2021-01-25 Mon 04:19]
- [X] Locate some papers and books
- [X] Summarize them
- [ ] Use =org-roam= to create notes about them.
** TODO Structure the paper for Hilton Root [0/3]
- [ ] Read the paper and make some notes
- [ ] Read the notes and create an outline for a paper based on this
- [ ] Evaluate to include simulations for some networks
** DONE Draft for the invitation to the seminar
